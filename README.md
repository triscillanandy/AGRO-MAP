When the users open the map  module  they should be able to see a map on their screen their  current location.
The map should suggest shortest path between the person and the closest business next to him/her according to the search
Initially the user must be able to enter the desired area for which the user wants to search for utilities. There should be an option that takes current location as the desired location.
After selecting the appropriate result from the search results ,the user must now be shown the map with overlays on the exact location of the business. 
Touching the Map overlay of a location should show the detailed information about that business. For example if a user searched for farms in an area , touching the overlay of a farm  location on the map should show the details about the business farm  , like  business name, distance ,ratings
